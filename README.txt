Sassafras
=========

After spending hours copying and pasting hex values into my Sass stylesheets, 
I knew there had to be a better way.  Enter Sassafras, the Sass color scheme 
generator.

Sassafras will generate any of the following types of color schemes and create 
logically-named Sass variables for varying lightnesses:

* basic
* complementary
* analogous
* triadic
* split complementary
* rectangle
* square

Installation
============

Note:  Make sure you're using RubyGems >= 1.2.0.

    $ sudo gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
    $ sudo gem install teejayvanslyke-sassafras

Usage
=====

Generate basic variants of red:
    
    $ sassafras -b red

    # Generated by Sassafras
    # accent1
    !accent1_lighter = #ffffb3
    !accent1_light = #ffff80
    !accent1_lightest = #ffffe6
    !accent1_darkest = #1a1900
    !accent1_dark = #807f00
    !accent1_darker = #4d4c00
    !accent1_mid = #ffff00

    # accent2
    !accent2_lighter = #b3ffff
    !accent2_light = #80ffff
    !accent2_darkest = #001a19
    !accent2_dark = #00807f
    !accent2_mid = #00ffff
    !accent2_lightest = #e6ffff
    !accent2_darker = #004d4c

    # complement
    !complement_darkest = #001a00
    !complement_mid = #00ff00
    !complement_darker = #004d00
    !complement_light = #80ff80
    !complement_dark = #008000
    !complement_lightest = #e6ffe6
    !complement_lighter = #b3ffb3

    # base
    !base_light = #ff8080
    !base_darkest = #1a0000
    !base_dark = #800000
    !base_darker = #4d0000
    !base_lightest = #ffe6e6
    !base_mid = #ff0000
    !base_lighter = #ffb3b3

Generate basic variants of red and green:

    $ sassafras -t complementary -b red

Sassafras can also generate an HTML reference sheet with color swatches:

    $ sassafras -t split_complementary -b blue -f html
