Sassafras
=========

After spending hours copying and pasting hex values into my Sass stylesheets, 
I knew there had to be a better way.  Enter Sassafras, the Sass color scheme 
generator.

Sassafras will generate any of the following types of color schemes and create 
logically-named Sass variables for varying lightnesses:

* basic
* complementary
* analogous
* triadic
* split complementary
* rectangle
* square

Installation
============

Note:  Make sure you're using RubyGems >= 1.2.0.

    $ sudo gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
    $ sudo gem install teejayvanslyke-sassafras

Usage
=====

Generate basic variants of red:
    
    $ sassafras -b red

    # Generated by Sassafras
    # base
    !base_light = #ff8080
    !base_darkest = #1a0000
    !base_dark = #800000
    !base_darker = #4d0000
    !base_lightest = #ffe6e6
    !base_mid = #ff0000
    !base_lighter = #ffb3b3

Generate basic variants of red and green:

    $ sassafras -t complementary -b red

Sassafras can also generate an HTML reference sheet with color swatches:

    $ sassafras -t split_complementary -b blue -f html
